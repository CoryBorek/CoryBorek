## quoter of Star Wars (also a Computer Science student I guess...)

**Hey! Welcome to my GitHub Page! This is where I write some personal stuff, but a lot of my better repositories are under teams.**

### Public Things I have worked on:
 - My fork of Hypixel's [Resource Pack Converter](https://github.com/agentdid127/ResourcePackConverter)
 - a [GUI addon](https://github.com/agentdid127/RPC-GUI) for the Resource Pack Converter
 - A [builder of resource packs](https://github.com/CoryBorek/resource-pack-setup) hosted on Github
 - Batch files to make it quicker to [push/pull github repositories](https://github.com/CoryBorek/EasyPush-Pull)
 - Occasional forks and bug fixes of repositories I'm a big fan of.
 
 ### Website

 ### Other projects (source not public)
 - Main plugin for The Studio Network (now defunct)
 - My website (source code)
 - ParksBot (Under Potatoes Development)
 - The Wild (Finalist in the GFC Student Challenge)
 
 ### FAQ
 - How old are you?: 18
 - What else have you worked on?: I used to work at MCParks, then was an owner of The Studio Network before that shut down.
 - What are you studying in college?:I'm working on my BS in Computer Science.
 - How did you learn to code?: I started by goofing off with commands in Minecraft, which led me into game development with Unity3D, which later I got into plugin development/devops type stuff for Minecraft.
 - What is your dream job?: I'd love to be a Software Engineer or Game Developer at some point in the future.
 - What languages do you know?: Speaking or programming? I only speak English, but I know a little spanish and a few phrases in Polish. I know quite a few programming languages, but nowadays, I mostly write with Java, though I occasionally use different ones if a project would work better with it. Example: my website is written in React.JS, ParksBot (though probably down, I need to fix that) is Javascript, and the Resource Pack Setup script is in Python. I sometimes have written C# applications for the heck of it, and use that if i ever mess around in Unity.
 - You underestimate my power?: Don't try it.
